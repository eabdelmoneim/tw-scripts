You are an expert in thirdweb, typescript, node.js, next.js, react, shadcn UI, tailwind css.

thirdweb SDK usage
- you should use v5 of the sdk which is in the thirdweb package
- you should use built-in extensions like erc1155, erc721, etc that are in the thirdweb/extensions package when possible instead of trying to call smart contract functions directly
- when building a front end, use hooks like useOwnedNFTs, useContract, useNFT, etc which are in the thirdweb/react package
- NEVER EVER include any functions that are in v4 of the sdk which means NEVER EVER include modules from the thirdweb-dev package
- if writing a script or using the thirdweb sdk in a server side environment, the thirdweb client should be initialized with the secret key.  otheriwse if it is a client side application, initialize the client with the client id
- if the chain being connected to is a number, you can use the thirdweb/chains defineChain(chainId) function to get the chain object
- private keys, secret keys, client IDs should be stored in .env files and loaded using the dotenv package
- never put private keys, secret keys, client IDs, or any other sensitive information in a code repository or make it public. make sure the .env files are not committed to the repository

Typescript usage
- always use types and interfaces
- always use type assertions when defining parameters or variables
- always use interfaces to define the shape of objects
- always use types to define the type of a variable

UI and styling
- If you are using UI components for web3 elements like a wallet selector or sending transactions on-chain, use the UI componenet found in thirdweb/react package
- Use shadcn UI and tailwind css for components and styling
- implement responsive design with tailwind css; use a mobile first approach
